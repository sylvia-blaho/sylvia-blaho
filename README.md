üìú As  Technical Writer of 10+ years, I have worked at a variety of companies: FinTechs ([N26](https://n26.com/en-eu), [Mambu](https://mambu.com/en/)), an engineering-focused IIoT company ([relayr](https://www.munichre.com/mrv/en/portfolio/relayr.html)) and a Web3 company focusing on security & privacy ([Least Authority](https://leastauthority.com/)). As diverse as the subject matter for each of my roles was, the unifying factor was that precise, up to date and accessible documentation was of paramount importance, with serious implications for shortcomings. 

üåç I have worked with remote teams from all over the world well before it became wide-spread, and saw proof that reliable, well-organized documentation and well-defined ways of working increase team productivity even without physical proximity.

üéì Before transitioning to the tech sector, I worked at several universities and research institutes, designing and delivering courses, editing & typesetting research articles & books, and producing original research content.

In addition to my documentation work, I have continuously been learning more about hands-on web development and writing APIs (see my web development projects on [my other profile](https://github.com/blahosyl).

As a significant portion of my work is confidential, I have collected a few different samples for review:

1. [User guides for audiences with limited technical knowledge](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6SxdX8wGqhvdGdVMUFQdzczTzA)
2. [API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI](https://github.com/blahosyl/mambu_assignment/)
3. Advanced cryptographic theory & applications in this repository
